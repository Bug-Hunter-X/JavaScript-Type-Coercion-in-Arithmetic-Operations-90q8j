# JavaScript Type Coercion Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion in arithmetic operations.  JavaScript's dynamic typing can lead to unexpected behavior when performing mathematical calculations with mixed data types (numbers and strings). 

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with explicit type checking.
